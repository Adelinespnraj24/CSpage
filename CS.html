  <h2><center><u>What is Computer Science?</u></center></h2>
  <p>Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems. It is a broad field which includes everything from the algorithms that make up software to how software interacts with hardware to how well software is developed and designed. Computer scientists use various mathematical algorithms, coding procedures, and their expert programming skills to study computer processes and develop new software and systems.</p>
<center><h2><u>Top 5 Domains in CS</u></h2></center>
<p>
  <h3><u>1. Artificial intelligence (AI)</u></h3><br>
  Artificial Intelligence is the field of computer science that deals with a computing system's capacity to resolve challenges, make forecasts, or complete intricate assignments. It involves having computers learn to undertake functions and resolve problems without external help. The field of artificial intelligence also comprises designing and analyzing independent agents interacting rationally with their environment. Artificial Intelligence applications leverage recent technology that translates spoken and written words and machine learning to make predictions. Common careers in the field of artificial intelligence include AI researchers, architects, and machine learning engineers.
  <br><br><h3><u>2. Human-computer interface</u></h3><br>
  This field of computer science deals with the numerous ways through which people interact, communicate, and relate with computers. This relationship can be through websites, virtual reality, mobile devices, and voice-enabled speakers. In turn, this field concerns itself with creating efficient relations between human users and computers. Professionals in this field also deal with designing the interface that aids and supports human users and computers. Disciplines like anthropology, psychology, sociology, and engineering are the foundation disciplines from which this field derives inspiration. Examples of careers in this field include user experience, research, and design.
  <br><br><h3><u>3. Game design</u></h3><br>
  This computer science field involves the creation of lifelike images that characterize modern games. It also extends to machine learning and artificial intelligence applications that help evaluate players' progress through games. Game design relates to how front-end designers, back-end designers, and developers work together to design an excellent product experience. Examples of careers in this field of computer science include video game designers, programmers, and software engineers.
  <br><br><h3><u>4. Computer networks</u></h3><br>
  This computer science field involves designing, analyzing, and implementing networks that connect computers. Some of these networks include local-area networks, mobile networks, and wide-area networks. In addition, this field seeks to determine how entities use networks to trade information with external and internal collaborators. Computer networks generally connect computers through infrared signals, radio waves, TV cables, communication satellite links, or a combination of any or all of them. Careers in this field include network administrators, analysts, and architects.
  <br><br><h3><u>5. Graphics in computers</u></h3><br>
  This field deals with the images that computer scientists use in several software applications. These include computer designs, games, and multimedia publishing. Essentially, this field considers the control and display of images on screens of computer devices. Computer graphics comprise rendering, animation, visualization and modelling, and effectively incorporating them into one another. Useful applications in this field comprise CAD, fine arts, and graphics design. Computer scientists leverage these applications to create images for all types of devices regardless of the size of the display screens, bandwidth, and system memory. They also work to ensure the images are realistic.
